About our project -
Our project, the Word Grid Solver, utilizes a Python implementation of Depth-First Search (DFS) within a Tkinter GUI interface to navigate through a grid of letters, searching for specified words. The application efficiently identifies words by recursively exploring neighboring grid cells. Once found, the words are elegantly displayed in the GUI, along with a message indicating their presence. If a word is not found, the system also provides clear feedback to the user, enhancing the overall user experience and interaction. (Used Libraries - tkinter and random)

DFS- 
Depth-First Search (DFS) is an algorithm used to traverse or search tree or graph data structures. It explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. 
The algorithm starts at a chosen node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. 
It uses a stack to keep track of nodes to visit. At each step, DFS selects an unvisited neighbor of the current node and continues recursively until no unvisited neighbors remain.
DFS is often used in maze solving, topological sorting, and cycle detection in graphs, among other applications.
It's simple, efficient for connected components, and easy to implement recursively or iteratively.

Tkinter -
Tkinter is a widely-used Python library for creating Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). 
It offers a comprehensive set of tools and widgets that enable developers to build interactive applications with ease. 
Tkinter offers enough flexibility to build complex applications, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced developers alike.
Its seamless integration with other Python libraries further enhances its utility in building robust and feature-rich GUI applications.
